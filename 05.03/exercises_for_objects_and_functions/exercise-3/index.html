    <h1>Exercises for OBJECTS and FUNCTIONS</h1>
    <h2>Exercise #3</h2>
    <pre>
      Step 1: 
        Prompt for a first name, 
        then prompt for a last name, 
        then prompt for a teudat zeut.
   
      Step2: 
        Once you have all three of these infos, 
        create a user object using a function. 

      Step 3: 
        Add the object you just created to an array.
 
      Step 4: 
        Ask the user if he wants to add another user 
        by using the “confirm” method.  
        If he clicks OK, repeat steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 
        until he presses cancel to adding a new user. 

      Step 5: 
        console log three times with three DIFFERENT arrays.  
        One with all the first names in alphabetical order, 
        one with all the last names in alphabetical order, and 
        one with the teudat zehut numbers in ascending order.
