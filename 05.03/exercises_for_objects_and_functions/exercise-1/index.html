    <h2>Exercise #1</h2>
    <pre>
      Input a string (Prompt).  

      Create a function that returns an array 
      with two elements, one with all the vowels 
      separated by a comma and in alphabetical order, 
      and a second with all the consonants also separated 
      by a comma and in alphabetical order. 

      Then call a second function that receives that array 
      and outputs a message as follows:  
      "Your string contains the following vowels:..... 
      And the following consonants:...." 

      Ex:  INPUT:  "Meir Sabbah"
      OUTPUT:  "Your string contains the following 
      vowels: a, a, e, i.  And the following 
      consonants: b, b, h, m, r, s.
